<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the 2015 Cricket World Cup, 
  which was played in Australia and New Zealand. It was the fifth Cricket World Cup played in England, following the 1975, 1979, 1983 and 1999 World Cups. 
  Wales also hosted matches at the 1983 and 1999 tournaments, the latter also seeing matches played in Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands.

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fixture list for the tournament was released on 26 April 2018 after the completion of an ICC meeting in Kolkata, India. 
  London Stadium had been named as a possible venue in the planning stages, and in January 2017, the ICC completed an inspection of the ground, 
  confirming that the pitch dimensions would be compliant with the requirements to host ODI matches.[18] However, when the fixtures were announced, 
  London Stadium was not included as a venue. All of the venues used are in England except for Sophia Gardens, which is in Wales.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening ceremony took place on The Mall in central London during the evening of 29 May 2019, 
  a day before the start of the World Cup. Andrew Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Shibani Dandekar hosted the event. 
  Prior to the opening ceremony, the 10 captains met at Buckingham Palace where they were greeted by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Harry.
  A 60-second challenge took place among the 10 participating 'teams', with each side represented by two guest figures, including Viv Richards, 
  Anil Kumble, Mahela Jayawardene, Jacques Kallis, Brett Lee, Kevin Pietersen, Farhan Akhtar, Malala Yousafzai, Yohan Blake, Damayanthi Dharsha, 
  Azhar Ali, Abdur Razzak, James Franklin and Steven Pienaar, while David Boon was the umpire for the game. England won the game by scoring 74 points, 
  and Australia came second with 69 points.
  
  Michael Clarke, who captained Australia to the title in 2015, took the World Cup trophy to the stage, accompanied by former England spin bowler Graeme Swann. 
  The ceremony concluded with the official World Cup song, "Stand By", performed by Loryn and Rudimental.</p>
